# Terraform

## Best practices for Terraform
- auto format terraform files
- follow naming convention
- use terraform import
- use the self variables
- backup state files
- validate the terraform code


## Docker


```
# terraform state list
docker_container.nginx
docker_image.nginx
```

`terraform state show docker_container.nginx`
