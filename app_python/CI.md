### Best Practices

1. **Environment Setup**: Utilize `actions/setup-python@v2` to establish a consistent Python environment, ensuring version compatibility across workflows.

2. **Unit Testing**: Execute `python -m unittest` for comprehensive unit testing, verifying code functionality and preventing regressions.

3. **Code Linting**: Employ `flake8` to enforce code style and syntax standards, enhancing code quality and maintainability.

4. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrate Snyk for dependency vulnerability scanning, identifying and addressing security issues within project dependencies.

5. **Docker Image Build and Push**: Streamline deployment with Docker image creation from `app_python` directory's Dockerfile, facilitating distribution via Docker Hub.
